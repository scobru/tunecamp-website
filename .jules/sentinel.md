## 2025-02-27 - [XSS in inline event handlers]
**Vulnerability:** XSS inside the string literal of an inline event handler in index.html (onclick="...").
**Learning:** HTML entity decoding occurs before inline JavaScript executes in an attribute. Therefore `&#039;` is decoded back into `'` and can break out of a JS string literal, making `escapeHtml` insufficient for defending against XSS in this context.
**Prevention:** Avoid dynamic interpolations within inline JS attributes. Instead store data using `data-*` attributes and retrieve them safely via `this.getAttribute(...)`.
