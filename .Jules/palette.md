## 2026-07-05 - Added ARIA labels to audio player controls
**Learning:** Found several icon-only buttons for critical functionality (play, pause, next track, shuffle, repeat) lacking accessible names. Without these labels, screen reader users would not know what these buttons do.
**Action:** Added descriptive `aria-label`s to these buttons. This ensures basic accessibility for the core audio player controls without altering the visual design.
